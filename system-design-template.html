            <div>
                <h3>(1) Use Cases</h3>
                <p>Understanding the primary and secondary functionalities of your system is essential. Clearly define the main features your system will provide and any additional features that support these primary functions.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>(2) Scenarios That Will Not Be Covered</h3>

            <h2>Understanding Fault Tolerance in System Design</h2>

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Fault tolerance is a critical aspect of system design that ensures a system remains operational even in the face of hardware or software failures. It involves designing systems with redundancy and resilience mechanisms to minimize downtime, maintain availability, and prevent data loss.</p>

            <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
            <p>Key concepts in fault tolerance include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Redundancy:</strong> Using duplicate components or systems to ensure continuity in case of failure.</li>
                <li><strong>Failover:</strong> Automatically switching to a redundant or standby system when a failure is detected.</li>
                <li><strong>Recovery:</strong> Processes for restoring system functionality and data integrity after a failure.</li>
                <li><strong>Isolation:</strong> Preventing failures from spreading across the system and affecting other components.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Availability and fault tolerance are crucial aspects of system design, but they address different aspects of system reliability. Here's a comparison:</p>

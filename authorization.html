                <p>Authorization is the process of determining what an authenticated user is allowed to do in a system. It controls what users can access and what actions they can perform, ensuring that sensitive data remains secure and only authorized actions are permitted.</p>

                <section id="2">
                <h2>Importance of Authorization</h2>
                <p>Authorization is crucial for maintaining security and protecting sensitive data. It ensures that users can only access information and perform actions that they are permitted to, based on predefined policies.</p>

                <section id="3">
                <h2>How Authorization Works</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><span class="bold-italic">User Authentication:</span> First, the user is authenticated to verify their identity.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold-italic">Access Control Policies:</span> The system checks its policies to determine what the authenticated user is allowed to do.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold-italic">Grant or Deny Access:</span> Based on these policies, the system either allows or blocks the user's request.</li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                
                <section id="4">
                <h2>Common Authorization Methods</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="bold-italic">Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):</span> Users are assigned roles with specific permissions. For example, an Admin can access everything, while a Regular User has limited access.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold-italic">Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC):</span> Decisions are based on various attributes like user role, department, and time. For instance, a user from the HR department can access employee records only during work hours.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold-italic">Access Control Lists (ACLs):</span> Lists define which users can access an object and what they can do with it. For example, User A can read and write a file, while User B can only read it.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold-italic">OAuth (Open Authorization):</span> Allows users to give third-party apps limited access to their resources without sharing passwords. For example, it lets a fitness app access your calendar to schedule workouts.</li>
                </ul>

                <section id="5">
                <h2>Best Practices for Authorization</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="bold-italic">Principle of Least Privilege:</span> Users should have minimal access needed to perform their job.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold-italic">Separation of Duties:</span> Tasks should be divided among users to prevent any one user from having too much control.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold-italic">Regular Reviews:</span> Periodically review and update access permissions.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold-italic">Strong Access Control Policies:</span> Create clear policies and enforce them consistently.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold-italic">Monitor Access:</span> Keep track of who accesses what and look for any unusual activity.</li>
                </ul>

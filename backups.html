                <h3>Backup</h3>

                <p>Backup refers to the process of creating copies of data to safeguard against accidental loss or deletion. It involves making regular copies of important files and storing them securely in a separate location from the original data.</p>

                <h3>Types of Backup</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Full Backup:</strong> Copies all data in its entirety. Provides complete restoration but requires more storage space and time.</li>
                    <li><strong>Incremental Backup:</strong> Copies only changes made since the last backup. Takes less time and storage space but requires the full backup and all subsequent incremental backups to restore data.</li>
                    <li><strong>Differential Backup:</strong> Copies changes made since the last full backup. Faster than incremental backup for restoration, as it requires only the full backup and the most recent differential backup.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Disaster Recovery</h3>

                <p>Disaster recovery focuses on restoring IT infrastructure and operations after a disruptive event. It encompasses processes, policies, and procedures to recover and protect a business's IT infrastructure in the event of a disaster.</p>

                <h3>Key Components of Disaster Recovery</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Backup Systems:</strong> Regularly scheduled backups of critical data and systems.</li>
                    <li><strong>Recovery Point Objective (RPO):</strong> Defines the maximum allowable data loss in case of a disruption. Determines the frequency of backups.</li>
                    <li><strong>Recovery Time Objective (RTO):</strong> Specifies the acceptable downtime for systems and services to resume normal operations after a disruption.</li>
                    <li><strong>Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP):</strong> Documented procedures outlining steps to recover IT infrastructure and operations after a disaster.</li>
                    <li><strong>Testing and Validation:</strong> Regular testing of the DR plan to ensure readiness and identify gaps or weaknesses.</li>
                </ul>


                <h3>Importance of Backup and Disaster Recovery</h3>

                <p>Backup and disaster recovery are critical for:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Minimizing downtime and ensuring business continuity.</li>
                    <li>Protecting against data loss, corruption, and cyber threats.</li>
                    <li>Meeting regulatory compliance and legal requirements.</li>
                    <li>Preserving customer trust and reputation.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <div class="note">
                    <p>Backup and disaster recovery (DR) are vital for a robust IT strategy, ensuring data and systems can be restored in case of loss, corruption, or a catastrophic event like a natural disaster or cyberattack, thereby providing data resilience, business continuity, and protection against disruptions.</p>

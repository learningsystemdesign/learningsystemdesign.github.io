                <h2>Backup</h2>
                <p>Backup refers to the process of creating copies of data to safeguard against accidental loss or deletion. It involves making regular copies of important files and storing them securely in a separate location from the original data.</p>

                <section id="2">
                <h2>Types of Backup</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="bold-italic">Full Backup:</span> Copies all data in its entirety. Provides complete restoration but requires more storage space and time.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold-italic">Incremental Backup:</span> Copies only changes made since the last backup. Takes less time and storage space but requires the full backup and all subsequent incremental backups to restore data.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold-italic">Differential Backup:</span> Copies changes made since the last full backup. Faster than incremental backup for restoration, as it requires only the full backup and the most recent differential backup.</li>
                </ul>

                <section id="3">
                <h2>Disaster Recovery</h2>
                <p>Disaster recovery focuses on restoring IT infrastructure and operations after a disruptive event. It encompasses processes, policies, and procedures to recover and protect a business's IT infrastructure in the event of a disaster.</p>
                
                <section id="4">
                <h2>Key Components of Disaster Recovery</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="bold-italic">Backup Systems:</span> Regularly scheduled backups of critical data and systems.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold-italic">Recovery Point Objective (RPO):</span> Defines the maximum allowable data loss in case of a disruption. Determines the frequency of backups.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold-italic">Recovery Time Objective (RTO):</span> Specifies the acceptable downtime for systems and services to resume normal operations after a disruption.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold-italic">Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP):</span> Documented procedures outlining steps to recover IT infrastructure and operations after a disaster.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold-italic">Testing and Validation:</span> Regular testing of the DR plan to ensure readiness and identify gaps or weaknesses.</li>
                </ul>

                <section id="5">
                <h2>Importance of Backup and Disaster Recovery</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Minimizing downtime and ensuring business continuity.</li>
                    <li>Protecting against data loss, corruption, and cyber threats.</li>
                    <li>Meeting regulatory compliance and legal requirements.</li>
                    <li>Preserving customer trust and reputation.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <div class="note">
                    <p>Backup and disaster recovery (DR) are vital for a robust IT strategy, ensuring data and systems can be restored in case of loss, corruption, or a catastrophic event like a natural disaster or cyberattack, thereby providing data resilience, business continuity, and protection against disruptions.</p>
